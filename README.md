# CODECRAFT_DS_02
In this second data science project for my internship, I will be using the American Football Dataset from 2009 to 2016. This dataset contains empty values and a few columns that need cleaning. I'll then perform EDA by visualizing some plots and looking at relationships of the data that is already clean.
